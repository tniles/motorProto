This project enables prototyping exploration of Qt and Arduino to the end of 
controlling motors from a PC.

On a PC, the Qt GUI provides connectivity and commands to communicate to an 
Arduino Redboard (Uno) over USB/serial and to provide basic commands for the 
Arduino to process.

This software is open source; see the file COPYING for licensing terms.
